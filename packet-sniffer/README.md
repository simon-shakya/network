To set up a Python-based network traffic analyzer that captures and analyzes packet data from live network interfaces, we can break the process into several steps, using libraries such as scapy for packet capture and analysis, and matplotlib for data visualization. Below is a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. Install Required Libraries
You'll need to install a few Python libraries:

scapy for packet capturing and analysis.
matplotlib for creating visualizations.
pyshark (optional) for integration with Wireshark (can be used if you prefer a Wireshark-like interface).
