## Description

This repository includes several network-related projects, such as:

- **Packet Sniffer**: Captures and analyzes network packets.
- **HTTP Server**: A simple web server that handles HTTP requests.
- **DNS Resolver**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses programmatically.
- **Socket Programming**: Implements both client and server socket communication.
- **Network Simulator**: Simulates different networking protocols (TCP, UDP, etc.).

These projects aim to provide both educational tools and practical solutions for network troubleshooting and analysis.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- C/C++ (for low-level network programming)
- Wireshark (for packet analysis)
- TCP/UDP
- DNS, HTTP
- Sockets API
- Wi-Fi & Ethernet network protocols
- Linux / Unix-based operating systems

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x (if your project is in Python)
- C Compiler (if your project is in C/C++)
- Wireshark (if using packet sniffing)
- `pip` for Python packages (if needed)

You may also need `libpcap` on Linux for packet capture functionalities.

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/simon-shakya/network.git
   cd network
